# Monte-Carlo-Matlab-Laser-sim
Monte Carlo simulation of laser absorption

This is a Matlab execution similar to the C++ software put out by  Steven Jacques, Ting Li, and Scott Prahl found here https://omlc.org/software/mc/mcxyz/index.html. I wrote this to understand the physics behind light simulations and to further improve upon it by allowing for K wave simulation in order to simulate photoacoustic imaging of tissue. I am using a homogenous tissue generator of my own making as well as the heterogenous tissue generator provided by Steven Jacques in his MATLab scripts. For both, I am using a tissue library provided by Steven Jacques that provides the optical properties necessary to perform this analysis. 

A More detailed explanation on how it works is coming soon, for now please look at the comments out in each script as it describes each part. Add tests and src to your workspace and run Demo to see how it performs.
