# Monte-Carlo-Matlab-Laser-sim
Monte Carlo simulation of laser absorption

This is a Matlab execution similar to the C++ software put out by  Steven Jacques, Ting Li, and Scott Prahl found here https://omlc.org/software/mc/mcxyz/index.html. I wrote this to understand the physics behind light simulations and to further improve upon it by allowing for K wave simulation in order to simulate photoacoustic imaging of tissue. I am using a homogenous tissue generator of my own making as well as the heterogenous tissue generator provided by Steven Jacques in his MATLab scripts. For both, I am using a tissue library provided by Steven Jacques that provides the optical properties necessary to perform this analysis. 

You can watch how the software works on the higher level here.

If you will excuse the chipmunk voice, I had to speed it up to make the 5 min time limit for the presentation. Over all the project was very fun, and I look forward to changing it up for my own personal use in the future. Stay tuned.
